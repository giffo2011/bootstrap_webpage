1 Project Description

    This project was built so that I could stretch my Bootstrap muscles and 
    practice utilizing this powerful tool in creating a simple web page.

    a  All the elements are responsive thanks to Bootstrap's easy-to-use commands. All the pictures resize to smaller screens and there is even features that modify for smaller screens. A button will appear on larger screens and dissapear on mobile devices. Also the navigation bar will convert to a hamburger button on smaller screens

    b This page also includes a registration form to enter your full name, as well as your email address and password. Make sure the read the terms and conditions before you check the "I agree" box!

    c Lastly, there is a table to show other users who are registred on our system. This table includes a hover effect so that users can clearly identify users. There is also a stiped design on all the table entries to make differentiating the different lines easier.

2 What I learned

    a This was my first time using Bootstrap to style a webpage. At first I was bewildered that my instructors went through all the trouble of teaching me CSS when a superior and more effient styling system exsisted. As I used Bootstrap I realized some things. Knowing CSS makes it easier to appreciate Bootstrap's streamlined design. Also, Bootstrap can fully design a website, but it is much more simplified and limited in its range of colors and features. On CSS there are thousands of colors and combinations that you can micro-manage to get just the right effect. With Bootstrap you use about a dozen colors designated by names like "warning" or "primary." 

    b I think that there are still applications for using CSS. When you want to style something in a specific way that Bootstrap is not capable of doing. But Bootstrap is such a useful program that you could design a whole website with it and be fine without using CSS.
